# About Me

Hey there, my name is Drew Fowles. Today, I will share a little bit about myself. I am 18 years old and I went to Layton High. I currently go to Weber State university. I am a freshman and this is my second semester of college. I'm studying mechanical engineering as my major. It's been a pretty fun major so that's always good. As for my job, I am currently working at a warehouse called My Mind's Eye. They sell mostly decoration products for specific holidays and events. What I do, is I package the products into boxes and get them ready for shipping through UPS. I also rearrange the storage area quite often. Just normal warehouse type of work. In my free time I'm usually either hanging out with friends, working out, or casual gaming. I'm usually down for anything though when given the offer. I think I'm a pretty normal dude just going with the flow of life.

## Interests and Hobbies

The one thing that I'm passionate about more than anything is sports. Mostly basketball and football, but I'll follow baseball occasionally. I will name some of my favorite teams in the table below. I did do swim team at Layton High. It was a blast and I was really sad when it came to an end my senior year. That's what happens when you do something for about 3 years. The reason I did that instead of basketball or football was because I wasn't good enough for the basketball team and my mom told me I wasn't allowed to play tackle football ever since I was a child. So, since I wanted to do a sport, the next best was swimming and I don't regret doing it at all. Anyway, now I just do Weber State sports classes. Which are also fun.
